                While I was working as a channel partnership in Fullscreen Inc.
                I was always seeking for the major related opportunities.
                Originated from my programmer essence, I was trying to build an app
                which was trying to help to improve the efficiency of data capture.

                It can help channel partners quicker identifies the top leaders
                in diffferent channel categories. And focusing on reaching in and out with
                potential customers.
